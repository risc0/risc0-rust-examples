# ZK Checkmate

Proves that a chess position has a checkmate without revealing what that checkmate is.

Takes a move that is kept private and an initial board state that is published to the journal. There are default values for these, but you can also pass in an alternative move and/or board state as command line arguments. The move is in SAN format and the board state is in FEN format.
