# Wordle in the zkVM

## Quick Start

First, make sure [rustup](https://rustup.rs) is installed. This project uses a [nightly](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html) version of [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html). The [`rust-toolchain`](rust-toolchain) file will be used by `cargo` to automatically install the correct version.

To build all methods and play Wordle within the zkVM, run the following command:

```
cargo run
```

Then, start guessing 5 letter words! 

## About the Game

The [game](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-rust-examples/blob/main/wordle/host/src/main.rs) consists of two agents: a player and a server. 
The zkVM enforces that the server plays fairly.

The game begins with the server choosing a secret word from the [wordlist](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-rust-examples/blob/main/wordle/host/src/wordlist.rs), and sending the player the hash of the secret word. 

The player then submits guesses. After each guess, the server returns which letters from the guess match the letters in the secret word. 
In addition, the server returns a [receipt](https://www.risczero.com/docs/explainers/proof-system/) that attests to the logic of the letter-checking and [includes the hash](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-rust-examples/blob/main/wordle/methods/guest/src/bin/wordle.rs) of the secret word. 

The player ensures that server isn't cheating using the [`check_receipt` function](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-rust-examples/blob/main/wordle/host/src/main.rs). 
This function first runs `receipt.verify(WORDLE_ID)` which ensures that the receipt is valid and was generated by the correct binary file. 
Then, `check_receipt` function checks that the journal contents on the receipt contains the hash of the secret word.
